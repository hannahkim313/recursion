# Recursion

## Project Summary
This project, created by The Odin Project, is a small exercise to practice working with recursive methods. The first part of the assignment uses the Fibonacci Sequence to demonstrate both iterative and recursive functions. The second part of the assignment uses the Merge Sort algorithm to demonstrate a practical use of recursion.
